In the previous blog in this series [](), we walked through through the Snowflake Architecture. In this follow-up, we will examine Snowflake's three caches, where they are 'stored' in the Snowflake Architecture and how they improve query performance.

# Snowflake Caches
Snowflake uses the three caches listed below to improve query performance. In each of the following sections, I will talk about each cache.
1. [Metadata Cache](## Metadata Cache)
2. [Query Result Cache](## Query Result Cache)
3. [Warehouse Data Cache](## Warehouse Data Cache)

## Metadata Cache
**Fully Managed in the Global Services Layer**

Snowflake automatically collects and manages metadata about tables and micro-partitions.

For Tables, Snowflake stores:
* Row Count
* Table Size in Bytes
* File references and table versions

For Micro-Partitions, Snowflake stores:
* The range of values (MIN/MAX values)
* Number of distinct values
* NULL Count

For Clustering, Snowflake Stores:
* The total number of Micro-Partitions
* Number of Micro-Partitions containing values overlapping with each together
* The depth of overlapping Micro-Partitions
  * This is an indication of how well-clustered a table is, since as this value decreases, the number of pruned columns can increase.

All DML operations take advantage of micro-partition metadata for table maintenance. In addition, some operations are metadata alone, and require no Compute resources in order to complete.

```plsql
SELECT MIN(L_SHIP_DATE), MAX(L_SHIP_DATE) FROM LINE_ITEM;
```
Snowflake also provides two system functions to view and monitor clustering metadata:
* SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH
* SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION

In addition, micro-partition metadata allows for the precise pruning of columns in micro-partitions:
1. Snowflake's pruning algorithm first identifies the micro-partitions required to answer a query.
2. Snowflake will only scan the portion of those micro-partitions that contain the required columns.
3. Snowflake then uses columnar scanning of partitions so an entire micro-partition is not scanned if a query filters by a single column.

## Query Result Cache
**Fully Managed in the Global Services Layer**

The query result cache is the fastest way to retrieve data from Snowflake. The query result cache contains a combination of Logical and Statistical metadata on micro-partitions. It used primarily for query compilation, but also for SHOW commands and queries against the INFORMATION_SCHEMA table.

If a user repeats a query that has already been run, and the data hasnâ€™t changed, Snowflake will return the result it returned previously.

Typically, query results are reused if:
* The user executing the query has the necessary access privileges for all the tables used in the query.
* The new query matches the previously-executed query (with an exception for spaces).
* The table data has not changed.
* The persisted result is still available. *The Query Result Cache will purge query results after 24 hours. This time period will be reset if the query is run again at any point*
* The micro-partitions have not changed.

In addition, persisted query results can be used to post-process results. The query result cache is also used for the SHOW command.
```plsql
  SHOW tables; --Returns the tables in the current schema
```
In order to show the tables that are empty, we can do the following:
```plsql
  SELECT "schema_name", "name" as "table_name", "rows" FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(LAST_QUERY_ID())) WHERE "rows" = 0;
```
In the above example, the RESULT_SCAN function returns the result set of the previous query pulled from the Query Result Cache!

## Warehouse Data Cache
**Implemented in the Virtual Warehouse Layer**

All Snowflake Virtual Warehouses have attached SSD Storage. This SSD Storage is used to store micro-partitions that have been pulled from the Storage Layer. Reading from SSD is faster. As such, when a warehouse receives a query to process, it will first scan the SSD cache for received queries, then pull from the Storage Layer.

The SSD Cache stores query specific FILE HEADER and COLUMN data. This cache type has a finite size and uses the Least Recently Used policy to purge data that has not been recently used.

During the course of this blog, we've examined the three cache structures Snowflake uses to improve query performance. For an analysis on the benefits of using the Result Set and Warehouse Storage caches, look at [Caching in Snowflake Data Warehouse](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Caching-in-Snowflake-Data-Warehouse).

As always, for more information on how Ippon Technologies, a Snowflake partner, can help your organization utilize the benefits of Snowflake for a migration from a traditional Data Warehouse, Data Lake or POC, contact sales@ipponusa.com.

[^1] FDN: *Flocon de Neige*, the proprietary file format which Micro-Partitions are stored as.

[^2] When defining a multi-column clustering key, the order of the columns matters. Snowflake recommends ordering columns from lowest to highest cardinality. In addition, when using a particularly high cardinality column, it is recommended to define the clustering key as an expression on that column in order to reduce the number of distinct values.

[^3] Snowflake does not currently support fixed-size arrays or arrays of elements of a specific non-VARIANT type.

[^4] XML is supported but is currently on public preview (meaning support for XML parsing and storage is functional, just not released fully into Production).
